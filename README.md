# TAGGIE

Taggie is a hide and seek/tag game with computers!

Player 1 possesses the computer, and must keep it away from Player 2 for at least 2 mins! Player 2 must try to press the space bar. If Player 2 fails in 2 mins, Player 1 wins! 

Players can hide, run from, or fight each other. The only rule: don't loose!
